    alt Basic Flow: Successful Synchronization
        CDB -> CDB: Validate and process records

            CDB -> CDB: Apply "Conflict Resolution Rule" (e.g., Keep Latest)
            CDB --> LB: Inform outcome (e.g., Record updated/skipped due to conflict)
            LB -> LB: Mark conflicting record as processed
        end
