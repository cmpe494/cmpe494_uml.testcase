title Centralized Log Management - Component Interaction Flow (UC-SC2)

' Define Participants
actor Admin as "Administrator"
participant Kiosk01 as "Kiosk-01 (Device)"
participant LogGenerator as "Log Generator"
participant LogSender as "Log Sender"
participant CentralLogServer as "Central Log Server"
database LocalBuffer as "Local Buffer"
database LogDB as "Log Database"

' === Basic Flow: Log Oluşturma ve Gönderme ===
note over Kiosk01, LogDB: Scenario: Device sends logs to Central Server
Kiosk01 -> LogGenerator: "User Login" event occurs
LogGenerator -> LogSender: Generate Log Entry (with timestamp)
LogSender -> CentralLogServer: Transmit Log
activate CentralLogServer
CentralLogServer -> LogDB: Store Log Entry
activate LogDB
LogDB --> CentralLogServer: Log Stored Confirmation
deactivate LogDB
CentralLogServer --> LogSender: Log Transmission Success
deactivate CentralLogServer

' === İstisna Akış 3a: Gönderim Hatası ve Retry ===
note over LogSender, Administrator: Scenario: Retry mechanism for failed log transmission
LogSender -> CentralLogServer: Attempt to send log (Initial transmission)

alt Initial transmission successful
    activate CentralLogServer
    CentralLogServer -> LogDB: Store Log
    activate LogDB
    LogDB --> CentralLogServer: Log Stored Confirmation
    deactivate LogDB
    CentralLogServer --> LogSender: Log received successfully
    deactivate CentralLogServer
else Initial transmission failed (Connection to Central Log Server is down)
    CentralLogServer --x LogSender: Connection failed
    LogSender -> LocalBuffer: Store Log in Local Buffer
    LogSender -> Administrator: Generate "Transmission Delayed" Warning

    loop Periodically until success
        LogSender -> CentralLogServer: Re-attempt to send log (from Local Buffer)
        activate LogSender
        alt Re-attempt successful (Connection restored)
            activate CentralLogServer
            CentralLogServer --> LogSender: Log received successfully
            CentralLogServer -> LogDB: Store Log
            activate LogDB
            LogDB --> CentralLogServer: Log Stored Confirmation
            deactivate LogDB
            LogSender -> LocalBuffer: Remove log from Local Buffer
            deactivate CentralLogServer
            break ' Exit loop on success
        else Re-attempt failed (Connection still down)
            CentralLogServer --x LogSender: Re-attempt failed
        end
        deactivate LogSender
    end
end

' === Basic Flow: Log Geri Çağırma (Retrieval) ===
note over Admin, LogDB: Scenario: Admin requests logs from a specific device
Admin -> CentralLogServer: Request logs for "GameClient-05"
activate CentralLogServer
CentralLogServer -> LogDB: Retrieve logs for "GameClient-05"
activate LogDB
LogDB --> CentralLogServer: Requested Logs (e.g., list of log entries)
deactivate LogDB
CentralLogServer --> Admin: Send logs to Admin's Dashboard for viewing
